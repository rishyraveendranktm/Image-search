How It Works:
You enter an image URL (Google requires a public link for reverse search).
The script opens Google Reverse Image Search with the image.
It also opens PimEyes (where you manually upload the image for a search).
ðŸ’¡ Limitations:

Googleâ€™s reverse image search works best with publicly accessible images.
PimEyes requires manual upload (they donâ€™t support direct URL search).
